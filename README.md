Finance Tracker FX:
A JavaFX-based program that helps students track their personal finances.

It also generates a summary regarding net gains/losses over specified periods of time and offers an easy search function. Finance Tracker FX allows students to easily update or delete existing transactions and transfer money between accounts. And to top it all off, Finance Tracker FX has a rules-based chatbot that helps users find instructions for specific tasks.
